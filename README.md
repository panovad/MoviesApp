# MoviesApp

MoviesApp is a mini iOS mobile application. The main goal of the app is to fetch a list of movies from The Movie Database API, show them in a UICollectionView, and provide one additional screen where more details about a certain movie are given.

In addition, we have a 'Favorite Movies' feature, which gives the user the ability to save movies as favorites, and look at them on another screen.
